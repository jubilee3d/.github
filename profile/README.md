## Jubilee Source Files

Welcome to the source files for the Jubilee project. For ease of browsing, repositories are organized by:
* 📡 machines
* 🔧 tools 
* 🛏️ bed plates
* 💡enhancements and mods to *machines*
* 🌎 project [website](https://jubilee3d.github.io/)
* 📒 templates

For the most part, repositories are self-contained. For example, *tools* can be, for the most part, assembled separately and then integrated onto Jubilee later.

Happy hacking!
