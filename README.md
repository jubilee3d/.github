# Jubilee Source Files

Welcome to the source files for the Jubilee project.

For ease of browsing, repositories are organized by:
* machines
* tools
* bed plates
* enhancements and mods to *machines*

For the most part, repositories are self-contained. For example, *tools* can be, for the most part, assembled separately and then integrated onto Jubilee later.
